\arguments{
\item{dt}{Data in long format.}

\item{lib}{Library with instructions regarding how to process data; see details.}

\item{detrend}{T/F should data be detrended (see details)?}

\item{center}{T/F should data be centered (i.e. de-meaned)?}

\item{scale}{T/F should data be scaled (i.e. variance 1)?}

\item{as_of}{"As of" date at which to censor observations for backesting. This requires `pub_date_name` is specified.}

\item{date_name}{Name of data column in the data.}

\item{id_name}{Name of ID column in the data.}

\item{value_name}{Name of value column in the data}

\item{pub_date_name}{Name of publication date column in the data; required if `as_of` specified.}

\item{ignore_numeric_names}{T/F ignore numeric values in matching series names in `dt` to series names in `lib`. This
is required for data aggregated using `process_MF()`, as lags of LHS and RHS data are tagged 0 for contemporaneous data, 
1 for one lag, 2 for 2 lags, etc. Ignoring these tags insures processing from `lib` is correctly identified.}

\item{silent}{T/F, supress warnings?}

data.table of processed values in long format.

\description{
Process data to ensure stationarity in long format for time series modeling
}
\details{
Process data can be used to transform data to insure stationarity and to censor data for backtesting. Directions
for processing each file come from the data.table `lib`. This table must include the columns `series_name`, `take_logs`,
and `take_diffs`. Unique series may also be identified by a combination of `country` and `series_name`. Optional columns
include `needs_SA` for series that need seasonal adjustment, `detrend` for removing low frequency trends (nowcasting only;
detrend should not be used for long horizon forecasts), `center` to de-mean the data, and `scale` to scale the data. If the 
argument to `process_wide()` of `detrend`, `center`, or `scale` is `FALSE`, the operation will not be performed. If `TRUE`,
the function will check for the column of the same name in `lib`. If the column exists, T/F entries from this column are used
to determine which series to transform. If the column does not exist, all series will be transformed.
